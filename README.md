[![Project Status: inactive](https://www.repostatus.org/badges/latest/inactive.svg)](https://www.repostatus.org/#inactive)

This repository contains a small, frozen analysis pipeline for PhIP-Seq
dermatology data (hidradenitis suppurativa vs psoriasis).
The goal is reproducibility, not ongoing development.

---

## 1. What you need

- A working installation of **R** (≥ 4.x).
- Command-line access (Linux/macOS terminal or Windows PowerShell).
- This repository cloned locally.
- The `phiper` source tarball is already included in the repository root
  (for example: `phiper_0.2.4.tar.gz`).

You do **not** need to download any external data: all required input files are
part of the repo or created by the scripts.

---

## 2. Clone the repository

Open a terminal and run:

```bash
git clone <your-repo-url>
cd dermatology_phipseq
```

All remaining commands below assume you are inside this project directory.

---

## 3. Install `phiper` from the bundled tarball

From the project root (the folder where you see the `phiper_*.tar.gz` file),
install `phiper` directly from the tarball.

### Option A: Command-line install (recommended)

```bash
R CMD INSTALL phiper_*.tar.gz
```

The `*` will expand to the actual versioned tarball name
(for example `phiper_0.2.4.tar.gz`).

### Option B: From within an R session

If you prefer to work inside R:

```r
install.packages("phiper_0.2.4.tar.gz", repos = NULL, type = "source")
```

Make sure you run this **from the project root**, or provide the full path to
the tarball.

Once this completes without errors, the `phiper` package is available for the
scripts.

---

## 4. Run the pipeline

There are two scripts, and you should run them **in order**.

### 4.1. Step 1 – Data preparation

This script prepares the input data (for example, the Parquet file used by the
analysis):

```bash
Rscript R/01-data-prepare.R
```

- Run this once.
- It will create the intermediate data files expected by the main analysis
  script (e.g. `data/derma_full.parquet`).

### 4.2. Step 2 – Main analysis

The main script performs all analyses (alpha/beta diversity, POP framework,
DELTA framework, and all plots). It writes everything into a newly created
`results/` directory.

**Important:** The script expects arguments in the form `KEY=VALUE`. You should
call it like this:

```bash
Rscript R/02-analysis.R N_CORES=30 MAX_GB=40 LOG=TRUE
```

#### Arguments

- `N_CORES`  
  Number of parallel workers used by the DELTA framework and some other steps.  
  Example: `N_CORES=30`  
  Choose this according to how many CPU cores you actually have or are allowed
  to use.

- `MAX_GB`  
  Rough memory limit (in gigabytes) for `future.globals.maxSize`.  
  Default in the script is `40`.  
  Example: `MAX_GB=50`.

- `LOG`  
  Controls logging for the DELTA framework step (`compute_delta`).  
  - `LOG=TRUE`  – write a log file per comparison.
  - `LOG=FALSE` – no log files.

- `LOG_FILE` (optional)  
  Path to a single log file that should be used instead of the per-comparison
  default. If you do not provide this, each comparison gets its own  
  `results/<group1>_vs_<group2>/DELTA_framework/log.txt`.

Example with all parameters:

```bash
Rscript R/02-analysis.R N_CORES=24 MAX_GB=60 LOG=TRUE LOG_FILE="my_delta_log.txt"
```

If everything runs correctly, you will end up with a populated `results/`
directory as described below.

---

## 5. Output: structure of the `results/` directory

The main script creates a top-level `results/` folder and then one subfolder per
comparison. This pipeline currently runs a single comparison: `hs_vs_pso`.

### 5.1. Top level

```text
results/
  peptide_library.rds
  hs_vs_pso/
```

- `peptide_library.rds`  
  RDS with the full peptide library as a plain `data.frame`.  
  This is used by several downstream steps (POP and DELTA frameworks).

Each comparison (e.g. `hs_vs_pso`) has its own directory:

```text
results/
  hs_vs_pso/
```

### 5.2. Per-comparison directory

Inside each comparison directory (here shown for `hs_vs_pso/`):

```text
results/
  hs_vs_pso/
    hs_vs_pso_data.rds
    enrichment_counts.svg
    alpha_diversity/
    beta_diversity/
    POP_framework/
    DELTA_framework/
```

#### Root files

- `hs_vs_pso_data.rds`  
  Filtered PHIP-Seq data for this comparison (only the two groups involved),
  saved as a `data.frame`.

- `enrichment_counts.svg`  
  Static SVG plot from `plot_enrichment_counts()`: enrichment counts by group.

---

### 5.3. `alpha_diversity/`

```text

## 6. Re-running and cleaning up

- Re-running `R/02-analysis.R` will **overwrite** the contents of the
  corresponding comparison directories inside `results/` if they already exist.
- If you want to keep old outputs, copy the whole `results/` folder elsewhere
  before running the pipeline again.
